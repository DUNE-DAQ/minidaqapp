MiniDAQ Application

[MiniDAQApp Diagrams](MiniDAQApp-Diagrams.md)

This repository has tools for generating MiniDAQ system configurations. At the moment, these tools consist of a single Python script that generates MiniDAQ system configurations with different characteristics based on command-line parameters that are given to the script.  This script is minidaqapp/python/minidaqapp/nanorc/mdapp_multiru_gen.py.  

The focus of this documentation is on providing instructions for using the tools and running sample MiniDAQ systems.
